# Release notes

## v0.9 
Excited to announce the release of admiral version `v0.9` with lots of cool functionality added and it is ready for production usage. Following are the highlights of this release:
We would like to thank all the contributors and everyone who played a role in testing the aplha and beta releases. 
* [Global Traffic Policies](./Architecture.md#Global Traffic Policy). Try out the [example](#TODO)
* Lots of improvements to usability (labels used by admiral are now configurable, annotation support to exempt deployments from Admiral processing)
* Simplified installing the examples and organized them by use case
* Bug fixes to handle some corner case events causing crashes
